#Intro to SocketIO

Start your server then got the localhost:3000 and enter a message in the chat service.

Once the message you sent is visibly posted that is actually you sending the message to a websocket server and it pushing the message to all connected clients which is currently only you but if deployed publicly this would update your client with any message sent by a connected client to the web socket server.
